    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "1. Decision Trees ([EliteDatascience](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms))\n",
    "    - Application: Data Mining Software Packages (CART, Matlab, etc.)\n",
    "    - Strenghts: Robust to outliers, scalable and able to model non-linear relationships.\n",
    "    - Weaknesses: Prone to overfitting\n",
    "    - Good candidate: As we have seen during the preprocessing of our data, there are some features with strong outliers or features that will lead to strong shifts in our prediction due to them being relatively large in comparison to other datapoints. Furthermore, the cost of using the tree is logarithmic, which should allow our decision tree to be easily scalable and the computation time should be very quick, even when training on the full dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Ensemble Methods ([EliteDataScience](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html))\n",
    "    - Application: Face Recognition, Emotion Recognition, Fraud Detection, etc.\n",
    "    - Strenghts: Similar to decision trees, they are robust, scalable and able to handle non-linearity\n",
    "    - Weaknesses: Hyperparameters need to be adjusted\n",
    "    - Good candidate: Ensemble methods are generally very good and robust classifiers and are able to adapt to the majority of scenarios in a dataset. According to Reference2, the fact that we have labeled data with less than 100.000 samples makes ensemble methods a good choice. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. K-Nearest Neighbors ([Revoledu](https://people.revoledu.com/kardi/tutorial/KNN/Strength%20and%20Weakness.htm), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html))\n",
    "    - Application: Similarity Search Applications\n",
    "    - Strenghts: Robust, effective if training data is large\n",
    "    - Weaknesses: Memory intensive\n",
    "    - Good candidate: There are a few reasons why K-Neighbors might be a suitable model. Firstly, our data is labeled, which makes a classification possible. Furthermore, we have less than 100.00 samples and we do not have any text data. Both of these factors, make the usage of K-Neighbors plausible according to Reference2.\n",

    "**Answer:** The best suited model for this application would be the GradientBoostClassifier. When compared to the DecisionTree and the Kneighbors model, it becomes clear that the ensemble methods are superior, since both the accuracy and the F-score on the testing set are higher. While the training time for the full dataset was the highest when using the ensemble method, I believe that the improved accuracy fully justifies this, since training has to be done just once anyway. I chose the GradientBoostClassifier out of all ensemble methods, because it had the highest F-Score on the testing data, closely followed by the AdaBoostClassifier. Ensemble methods in general are very robust, scale well to larger datasets and are able to handle non-linearity with ease. "

    "**Answer:** Before getting into detail with Gradient Boosting, let us first try to understand Ensemble Methods in general. The basic idea of these methods is to combine many weak learners into a model that allows us to make better predictions than the individual model. By weak learners, we refer to any model that will allow us to make predictions that are slightly better than the ones we would get by guessing. In the case of Gradient Boosting, the weak learners are decision trees. Decision trees are a simple way of establishing a relationship between decisions and their possible consequences. At each node of a decision tree, we try to answer a question about a certain feature: \"Is the individual over 30 years old?\", \"Does the individual work in the private sector?\" etc. until we reach a point where we can make a statement about the expected outcome $\\rightarrow$ \"Income above 50k?\". We then try to train the model based on the available data, by trying to find precisely the \"decisions\" that lead to an individual earning more than 50k. Since some decisions might be more important than others (as later seen in the section about feature relevance) we can also assign different weights to the decision. If, for example, 95% of the people aged over 40 earn more than 50k, then that decision would be a pretty important one and it would receive a high weight.<br>\n",
    "In the case of Gradient Boosting, we train the weak learners gradually and sequentially. This means that once the first learner, let us call it learnerA, is trained, the next learner, learnerB, will be trained on an altered dataset, given by the learnerA. LearnerB then tries to correct the shortcomings of learnerA by making little changes to the weights. LearnerC will try to do the same with the dataset provided by learnerB and so on. What differentiates GradientBoosting from other ensemble methods is how the \"shortcomings\" are evaluated. GradientBoosting makes use of a so called loss function, which essentially models the error that we are making and tells us how good our prediction is. It then tries to adjust certain parameters in a way that will decrease this error as much as possible. "

    "While I was right about the age, the hours per week and education playing a role, I am quite surprised to see capital-gain playing such a significant role. In hindsight, it makes sense for the marital status to play a significant role, since it is often the case that one of the parents is not able to work and has to stay at home. I could imagine people who reported capital gain to be more active in the workfield in general and thereby creating a higher income. \n",
    "What struck me the most, however, was to see that native countries were not among the five most relevant features. Maybe this is due to the fact that people earning more than 50.000 were a minority in the dataset anyway and therefore developing countries, for example, would not have as large an impact as expected.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
